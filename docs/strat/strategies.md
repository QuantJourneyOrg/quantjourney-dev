# Quantitative Trading Strategies

Quantitative trading strategies utilize mathematical models to identify trading opportunities. Here are some of the top strategies used by quantitative traders:

- **Statistical Arbitrage:**
  - Exploits price discrepancies between related assets based on historical correlation and mean reversion.
  
- **Momentum Investing:**
  - Follows the principle that assets that have performed well in the recent past will continue to perform well in the near future.

- **Mean Reversion:**
  - Based on the theory that prices and returns eventually move back towards the mean or average.

- **Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - Uses algorithms such as neural networks and decision trees to predict market movements based on large data sets.

- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):**
  - Involves making thousands of trades within seconds, exploiting small price gaps and trading volume.

- **Factor Investing:**
  - Focuses on capturing risk premiums in the markets through exposure to certain risk factors like size, value, and momentum.

- **Event-Driven Strategies:**
  - Seeks to profit from stocks or securities that are influenced by events such as mergers, acquisitions, or significant corporate announcements.
